  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS,
  is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
  alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
  [12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13]
  All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
